# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Experiments

## 1. Install NLTK and perform basic Corpus analysis using NLTK such as  
(i) frequency distribution  
(ii) learn about morphological features of a word by analysing it  
(iii) building word clouds  

## 2. TEXT CLASSIFICATION — BAG OF WORDS MODEL USING TOKENIZE AND VECTORIZE  

## 3.  
(i) Calculate bigrams from a given corpus and calculate probability of a sentence  
(ii) Apply add-one smoothing on sparse bigram table  

## 4. Binary Classification using suitable classification model (Naive Bayes)  

## 5. Calculate emission and transition matrix which will be helpful for tagging Parts of Speech using Hidden Markov Model.  
Find POS tags of words in a sentence using Viterbi decoding  

## 6. Implement an application of NLP using large language model — for  
Text embedding, and Text clustering,  
Text summarization, Chatbots for Text generation,  
Image generation, Image understanding, Audio and Video understanding  

## 7. TEXT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SEQUENCE MODEL USING CNN  

## 8. TEXT CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SEQUENCE MODEL USING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN, LSTM, GRU)  

## 9. TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE FOR TEXT TRANSLATION FROM ENGLISH TO FRENCH  

## 10. RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION BASED GEN AI TOOL — AGENTIC AI APPLICATION
